not mine \n
i forked and edited to make it typescripty, \n
it exports a class constructer or whatever the fuck, \n
HOW TO USE: \n
you copy index.ts to your project \n
you can rename it who cares \n
you import it from that index file or whatever you renamed it to \n 
and then const sauce = sauceNao(api_key) \n
and boom \n
sauce is your sauceNao instance or whatever\n

you do sauce.getSauce(<imageUrlOrPathHere>) \n

enjoy
