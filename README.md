not mine 

i forked and edited to make it typescripty, 

it exports a class constructer or whatever the fuck, 

HOW TO USE: 

you copy index.ts to your project 

you can rename it who cares 

you import it from that index file or whatever you renamed it to 

and then const sauce = sauceNao(api_key)

and boom

sauce is your sauceNao instance or whatever

you do sauce.getSauce(<imageUrlOrPathHere>)

enjoy
